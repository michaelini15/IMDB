# IMDB
An analysis of IMDB's top 1000 movies. This project includes data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. This project also includes numerous datasets, with three of them being combined into 
one. As a dataset and in what is relevant to us, the first dataset, IMDB_top_1000, that is not combined with any others gives us poster links, movie titles, runtimes, primary genres, IMDB 
ratings, the number of votes on, and the gross of every movie included on the list, though some gross values are missing. In addition, the second dataset, IMDB_overview_combined, that is 
the combination of three seperate datasets only gives us the poster links once again, movie titles once again, and the overview of every movie included on the list. Both datasets consist of 
the same list of movies.
